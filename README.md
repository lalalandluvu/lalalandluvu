# About me
Paul Li, born in 2002. 
Grew up in Shanghai, finished LSE with a bachelor's in International Relations, went to HEC Paris and Yale SOM for a master in management degree, not sure of future field of work yet (most likely finance or tech startup) with a strong interest in (vibe)-coding.

**lalalandluvu/lalalandluvu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Yuzeum, a Web 2.5 NFT trading platform, with a start-up team.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dutch, French, vibe-coding, CFA, man dressing style, how to memorize new friends' names.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: trying to find it!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with vibe coding, software dev
- 💬 Ask me about: Fencing, language-learning, Europe, China
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn/Email
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once mistook a super spicy pepper 🌶️ for a cherry 🍒 at a restaurant in Cancun, México, and my reaction made it an excellent way to get free ice creams 🍦 from the waiter.
